                <h1>What can we do with 100 Million monthly aggregated sessions from Africa?</h1> 
                <p style="color: blanchedalmond;">Africa has a rich and diverse history of music. The continent’s digital native youth have taken to online music streaming services in a big way. However, monetization remains a challenge for the artists, their labels and the digital platforms. Usiku Beats is a rhythm-based mobile game where the audience actively tap, swipe, and slide their fingers to the beat of their favorite songs. The game creates a fun new driver of engagement between the artists and their fans.
